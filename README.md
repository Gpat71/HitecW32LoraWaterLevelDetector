This Project was built from Electronic Clinic's "Wireless Water Level Indicator using LoRa and ESP32 | TTGO LoRa32" project.

However I used 2 Heltec wifi-lora-32-v3 Boards and an Ultrasonic Sensor JSN SR04T/AJ-SR04M

The original code can be found at https://www.electroniclinic.com/wireless-water-level-indicator-using-lora-and-esp32/

However the Heltec Boards I used are V3, incompatable with V2, and required different libraries and pins

I used https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series libraries and example code.
